Many brides-to-be plan their own weddings, but they do not have the experience of a professional wedding planner. One aspect of wedding planning that is particularly stressful is figuring out a timeline (when to send invitations, book venues, contact caterers, finalize the guest list, etc). Currently, many brides-to-be rely on wedding websites, such as theknot.com, to determine their wedding tasks and timeline. However, these websites provide general, encyclopedia-style articles, rather than personalized information that is easy to apply to their unique situation. The biggest obstacle that brides-to-be face during their wedding planning process is customizing a timeline to fit their needs. In addition, they find it difficult to incorporate feedback from all of the involved parties (fiance, family members, wedding party) at each stage of the timeline.
